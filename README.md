# Medical Cost Analysis - Project Global AI

Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

In this project, you will be trying to develop an end-to-end data science application using the
dataset given above. The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's
health insurance based on the given variables. While creating the project, try to follow the
instructions below and make sure that the project is unique.

### 1. Creating a Google Colaboratory File

* Make sure your project has .ipynb extension.
* Make sure that there are comment lines explaining the details in your project.
* When submitting the project, submit the cells of this .ipynb file so that the cells are run and the results are visible

### 2. Importing Required Libraries

* Import the required libraries for the project to the Colab environment.
* Import Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Sklearn libraries for data analysis

### 3. Perform An Exploratory Data Analysis

* Analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
  - Examine the distribution of Bmi (Body Mass Index).
  - Examine the relationship between “smoker” and “charges”
  - Examine the relationship between “smoker” and “region”.
  - Examine the relationship between “bmi” and “sex”.
  - Find the "region" with the most "children".
  - Examine the relationship between “age” and “bmi”.
  - Examine the relationship between “bmi” and “children”.
  - Is there an outlier in the "bmi" variable? Please review.
  - Examine the relationship between “bmi” and “charges”.
  - Examine the relationship between “region”, “smoker” and “bmi” using bar plot.

* Try to use data visualization techniques as much as possible while examining the
data.
* Please add the meanings you deduced from the analyzes as a comment line.

### 4. Data Preprocessing

* In this section, prepare the data you have, for training the model.
* Use Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding techniques to deal with categorical variables.
* Split your dataset into X_train,X_test, y_train, y_test.
* Scale the dataset by normalizing it(Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling).

### 5. Model Selection

* Select several regression models and train them with the preprocessed data.
* Examine the performances of the selected models using cross validation.
* Choose the best performing model.
* Hyper-parameter Optimization.
* Optimize the hyper-parameters of the model selected in the previous step.
* Optimize parameters with Grid Search. (Grid Search or Randomized Search).

### 7. Model Evaluation

* Evaluate the optimized model using regression model evaluation metrics. (Ex. Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error etc.)

### 8. Project Delivery

* For the project, you need to prepare a code file with the extension of .ipynb and run all the cells.
* You need to add these files that you have prepared to a GitHub repo and add the link of this repo to the form that is given down below.
* The project will be done as a team. The teams created should be a maximum of 3 people.
* You can send information about your project team via this form.
* Form Link: https://forms.gle/mVFcRmhk9magezw26
* Deadline: 10.10.2022
